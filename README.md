This is the Project Repo for Polygenic-Environmental Interplay Underlying Externalizing Behavior Trajectories

## File directory

#### File format

All analyses were conducted in Mplus. While Mplus is a paid software, .out files shared here contain all output obtained from Mplus and can be opened with any text editor.

#### GMM Scripts

Mplus scripts for GMM can be found under folder `GMM`. `sub` and `asb` prefix denote whether trajectories for substance use or antisocial behaviors were extracted. `int`, `lin`, and `quad` separate intercept-only, linear, and quadratic growth models. The number following `int`, `lin`, and `quad` indicates the number of latent classes extracted.

#### SEM Script

Mplus scripts for SEM can be found under folder `SEM`. Scripts for groups with genetic similarity to different ancestry groups were seperated by their postfix.
